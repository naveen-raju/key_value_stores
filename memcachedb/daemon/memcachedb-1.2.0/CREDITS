* Great Memcached community! The code of memcachedb is most based on 
Memcached <http://www.danga.com/memcached/>. Memcachedb 1.0.x is 
based on Memcached 1.2.x, and the preview version 0.1.x is based
on Memcached 1.1.x.

* Some of 0.1.x version code is inspired from Tugela Cache 
<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tugela_Cache>.

* Novey Donar<forever.sky81@gmail.com> contributed some code of 0.1.x
version.

* Caokai<caokai@staff.sina.com.cn> contributed some code of replication.
