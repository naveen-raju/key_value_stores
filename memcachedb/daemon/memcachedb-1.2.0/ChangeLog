  * lots of statistics code clean up; stats command adjusted for better rendering; now more replication statistics info is provided. 
  * more compact and verbose message for logging

  * New option '-e' to set percent of the pages in the cache that should be clean, used for memp_trickle call(only available when '-T' is presented).

  * Replace the database type setting option '-T' with '-B'
  * Now '-T' has new meaning that it fires a separate thread to do memp_trickle every xx seconds.

  * Warning: 'pkget' and 'pvget' private command now has been discarded. 
    MemcacheDB will be a more memcache protocol compatible daemon(append and
    prepend command will be implemented later), and will not add relational 
    data model any more, the structural data storage will be issued by another
    project (now internal only).
